-- | In combinatorial game theory, nimbers represent the values of impartial games.  They are the simplest way of making the ordinals into a Field.
--   See /On Numbers and Games/ by John Conway.
--
--   Nimber addition is defined by \(\alpha+\beta = \operatorname{mex}\{\alpha'+\beta, \alpha+\beta'\}\), where \(\operatorname{mex} S\) is the smallest ordinal not in \(S\).
--
--   Nimber multiplication is defined by \(\alpha\cdot\beta = \operatorname{mex}\{\alpha'\cdot\beta + \alpha\cdot\beta' - \alpha'\cdot\beta'\}\).
--
--   This module implements /finite/ nimbers.  The set of finite nimbers is the quadratic closure of the field with two elements.

--   Finite nimber multiplication is calculated as follows: the nimber square of a Fermat two-power is its sesquimultiple, while the nimber product of two distinct Fermat two-powers is their ordinary product.
--   The sesquimultiple of a Fermat two-power is equal to itself plus the product of all smaller Fermat two-powers.
